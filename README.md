# YAFEFW - Yet another frontend framework

As the name says, another frontend framework but this time it uses syntax similar to Flutter, in that you're rendering "Render Objects" from a Javascript object/JSON format to an HTML element and appending it to the document. No VDOM required, and it returns an HTMLElement type that you can manipulate manually if you desire.
